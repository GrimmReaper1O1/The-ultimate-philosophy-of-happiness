This is a work in progress based on my information regarding emotional intelligence and intellectual development as well as other things.
The work was derived from one of my earlier works on amazong called Fruit to gain an understanding of true happiness.
I lost the original word document and had to retrieve the text from a pdf, hence the occasional page numbers within the 
earier versions.
The work is free to read and eventually will be accessible through amazon.
You may not sell this work for profit or any part of this work, nor may you utilize this work in your writing without crediting me as 
a source. Any charity may make money off this work, but I advise they wait for completion of the work and they must credit the source
of the work to Luke Lenacio.
